I finally decided to start a blog. And why blog? You might ask. Fairly recently, I redefined myself to be “an avid learner of all things” and commited myself to taking the creative challenge to learn the skill of learning and unlearning and becoming a better student of life and technology. For the most part, this blog is intended to cover technology but expect to find some more insteresting topics that are only pieces to living a more well rounded and satisfactory life, in my opinion. With that said, here are my current reasons for starting to blog;

### 1. Share my knowledge and experiences and create a producitve ecosystem
I first approached IT in the most incovinient way, by isolating myself which inhibited my ability to present my strengths as well as my weaknesses which meant I couldn’t present my value neither could I get the opportunity to be corrected and taught, to give me a chance at improvement. Looking back I still find that my most productive moments were when I was in complete harmony with my environment, which mostly meant people. I’ve come to learn that you need people to do things, their input, feedback and collaboration. Even better if these people are doing things and building stuff themselves. To my luck, I found that a lot of people in tech were ready to collaborate and share their knowledge and inspire, special thanks to [Wiza Jalakasi](https://wiza.jalaka.si/), [Ian Bwana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbwana/), [Charles Omwa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-omwa-620324163/) and [Stern Semasuka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stern-semasuka/). I have been inspired to be passionate and take pride in what I do and I would love to influence more people to get interested in getting immersed in the world of tech.

### 2. A better way to learn
A good way to learn is by teaching other people what you have learnt and in the process of teaching, identifying the gaps within your knowledge and revising them and repeating the process; which is called the Feynman Technique.

I have always found that taking notes while reading cemented the subject in my mind. And I found that the more I followed these principles the easier it became. Essentially, reading and writing are generally a foundational part of building the muscle which is your mind.

### 3. Developing good habits and inspired by the 'intellectual life'
Reading is essentially a workout for the mind. Reading and writing, are a long lost skill in this generation of highly pixelated Youtube and Instagram. I decided that I would start the culture of taking some time to go old school and read and write as much as I can. I also discovered an interesting concept of what makes one's life an intellectual one which was pointed out to having something that nobody can take away from you and is personal to you like a set of personal hobbies and I started taking a keener interest in my simple old pleasures like making a rubber band ball or could be something as simple as gardening. In doing this, what one essential does is build on their inner resources which are for example creativity, intelligence, passion, confidence and resilience. Moving forward I intend to continue to find new hobbies that bring me joy and satisfaction.

###    4. Accountability and track learning progress
 with this blog I also hope to be able to look back and see how small consistent steps in the right direction can lead to big results. I am motivated through this to become a better learner of all things, a better teacher and writer and most importantly to demand excellence in my field of study. Significant figures like, Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelius who was also a stoic philosopher, reaped the benefits of journaling to structure his thougths and be accountable to oneself. The difference between a blog and a journal is the audience, I’ll be careful not to write about how I am embarassed about eating 25 chapos on this one, I promise!
