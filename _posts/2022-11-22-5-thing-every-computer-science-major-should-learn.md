#### 8 Things  Computer Science Majors Should Learn.

### 01. Learning How To Learn
One of the biggest challenges in the CS field is learning how to learn. You'll need to master techniques used by experts in many other fields, such as how the brain uses two very different learning modes and how it chunks information—not to mention that you'll have to deal with procrastination and other forms of distraction.

I highly recommend a free course on Coursera called "Learning How to Learn." In my opinion, the biggest asset a developer can equip him or herself with has to be the ability to persevere through complex and tough subjects while enjoying the process.

### 02. UNIX Philosophy
The Command Line Interface is a text interface that is navigated by typing commands at prompts, instead of using the mouse through the Graphic User Interface.

The terminal is a great tool that gives you more control over any system. From the ability to store scripts for automating regular tasks to the ability to much easier and faster troubleshooting and administration of networks. Once a developer understands the CLI, a lot of time and resources can be saved while performing tasks.

### 03. Programming Language
Programming languages are critical tools. They are a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computing device to perform specific tasks. Having at least one programming language in your arsenal is a vital tool in your journey in computer science.

Yet, to truly understand programming languages, one must implement one. Ideally, every computer science major should be involved in building a software application. After all, it’s only by learning how to use these tools that you can fully comprehend their power and influence on our lives today — as well as their role in shaping our future.

### 04. Data Structures and Algorithms
Data Structures are most commonly used when we have large amounts of data to be stored and retrieved. They help compress data, keeping it organized and easy to access. More important than knowing a specific algorithm or data structure (which is usually easy enough to look up), computer scientists must understand how to design algorithms. 

This topic is especially important because it shows not only that you are able to explain things well, but also that you can apply your knowledge across a wide range of problems.

### 05. Git and Collaboration
Git is an open-source software tool that enables multiple developers to work together on the non-linear development of a project, such as when working on small or large projects. Since it's open-source, anyone can contribute to its development and make suggestions for improvements. It's also designed for speed, allowing for fast turnaround times when making changes in source code.

GitHub is where you'll find copies of your Git repository—this is where you upload copies of your projects so others can view them and use them as well (and vice versa).

### 06. Database Administration
The database is the backbone of any business system. Without a good database system, you're missing out on valuable information that can help you to make better decisions and ultimately drive more sales.

A database system stores essential data about a system: the data, when analyzed, becomes valuable information about a company and helps in the decision-making process.

### 07. Network Infrastructure
In the age of digital transformation, organizations need to ensure that their IT networks are ready for the future. It is important to understand what types of problems can occur in a network and how they might be mitigated. 

Despite the many benefits of using networks, networking raises a greater potential for security issues. The most common security issues include data loss, security breaches, and malicious attacks, such as hacking and viruses.

### 08. UX Design & Communication
In order to succeed in modern computer science, it's not enough to be an expert programmer.

It's important to be able to communicate your ideas clearly and persuasively with non-programmers. Whether or not a programmer can communicate ideas determines the success or failure of a business system.

CS students present their work and defend their ideas with oral presentations. It also doesn't stop there without the ability for programmers to build user-friendly interfaces for non-programmers.
