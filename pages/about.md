## About Me 

Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur on a mission to empower 1M+ young people using sports, technology, and entrepreneurship as transformative tools.

I love learning and conversely, this blog serves to share valuable insights on business, entrepreneurship, and technology; beyond software.

If you have the slightest interest in building and delivering great products and services, this blog is for you! 

## Laying The Bricks

At an early age, I picked up fundamental success principles through sports, which laid the foundation for my entrepreneurial journey and my career in technology. While my childhood dreams revolved around sports science and engineering, entrepreneurship never crossed my mind until I stumbled upon Robert Kiyosaki's inspiring books and philosophies, and my perspective shifted; fueling my burgeoning entrepreneurial spirit!


I'm actively building, [Digital Ducks](https://www.digitalducks.co.ke), a dynamic enterprise with a focus on helping businesses thrive in the emerging digital landscape and achieve growth and success. At the same time, the idea for Young Invested originated from my journey as a young individual navigating the pursuit of success through education and entrepreneurship. Along this path, I encountered challenges like an identity crisis and a sense of being lost, lacking a network of like-minded individuals to inspire and tap into my potential.

Founded as a solution to these challenges, [Young Invested](https://www.younginvested.org), aims to create a sense of community for ambitious individuals, fostering ideas and nurturing them through the transformative power of sports, technology, and entrepreneurship and in turn enabling social and economic growth within our communities. We believe in harnessing the transformative potential of these fields and providing the essential tools, resources, mentors, and opportunities for our communities to thrive and create positive change.
