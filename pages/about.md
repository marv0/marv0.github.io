### Hello, world!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a customer-facing software engineer developing apps and websites that prioritize the needs and engagement of their intended end-users. By blending my technical expertise, UI/UX design principles, and a user-centric approach, I craft digital products that meet consumer needs and deliver exceptional user experiences. 

Additionally, my entrepreneurial spirit has driven me towards a deep commitment to making a positive impact on Africa's socioeconomic landscape. Through [Young Invested](https://www.younginvested.org), we harness the power of technology, sports, and entrepreneurship to empower young people all over Kenya and act as catalysts for socioeconomic growth.

Let's network, break barriers and explore uncharted territories!
