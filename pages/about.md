### Hello, world!ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to my blog! Iâ€™m Marvin Ogot, an entrepreneur and software engineer based in Kenya. 

As a software engineer, I develop apps and websites that prioritize the needs and engagement of end-users. By blending my technical expertise, UI/UX design principles, and a user-centric approach, I craft digital products that meet consumer needs and deliver exceptional user experiences.

At an early age, I learned the importance of having a competitive edge and drive through competitive sports, which laid the foundation for my entrepreneurial journey. While my childhood dreams revolved around sport's science and engineering, the idea of entrepreneurship never crossed my mind until I stumbled upon Robert Kiyosaki's inspiring books; "Rich Dad Poor Dad", "Why A Students Work for C Students" and "Before You Quit Your Job," my perspective shifted, fueling my burgeoning entrepreneurial spirit.

After graduating in 2020, I immediately ventured into laying the foundation of establishing my own company, Digital Ducks, which I have taken to new heights, offering innovative digital solutions to businesses. Our expertise spans software development, media production, digital marketing, and IT support services, enabling businesses to navigate the evolving digital landscape and achieve growth and success.

Additionally, my entrepreneurial spirit has driven me towards a deep commitment to making a positive impact on Africa's socioeconomic landscape. Through Young Invested, we harness the power of technology, sports, and entrepreneurship to empower young people all over Kenya and act as catalysts for socioeconomic growth. By leveraging the transformative power of sports, technology, and entrepreneurship, we strive to provide the tools, resources and mentors required to create opportunities and drive positive change within our communities.

Letâ€™s network, break barriers and explore uncharted territories!
