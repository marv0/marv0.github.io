# About The Author

Hello, world! I'm Marvin Ogot.

I'm a software developer with some experience building functional web and mobile applications. In my arsenal, I have the Flutter framework and Dart programming language as some of my most reliable tools. And who would miss out on Python?

Besides technology, I love building companies that help businesses and indiviuals altogether.
