Hello, world!ðŸ‘‹ I am a competent software developer who has expertise in Dart, Python, and PHP. My competencies in those languages and their associated frameworks allow me to utilize reliable and effective tools to solve a wide range of problems using code.

In addition to my IT background, I am also an entrepreneur who is dedicated to making a positive impact on Africa's future through the use of technology, sports, and entrepreneurship as means to empower young people and drivers of socioeconomic growth.

I am always eager to explore new ideas and interests while seeking opportunities to push boundaries and foster innovation.
