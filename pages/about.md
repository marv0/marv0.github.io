### About Me 

Hello, world!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Marvin Ogot and Iâ€™m an entrepreneur and software engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya. Welcome to my blog!

I started this blog to keep track of my learning and share relevant information on diverse topics on business and entrepreneurship, and various technologies (*not limited to software*). *Additionally, I may cover topics related to personal development, sustainability, tools and tool-making among other stuff.* If you have the slightest interest in building and delivering great products and services, then this blog is for you!

### Enterpreneurial Drive

At an early age, I learned the importance of having a competitive edge and drive through sports, which laid the foundation for my entrepreneurial journey. While my childhood dreams revolved around sport's science and engineering, the idea of entrepreneurship never crossed my mind until I stumbled upon Robert Kiyosaki's inspiring book; "Rich Dad, Poor Dad", and my perspective shifted, fueling my burgeoning entrepreneurial spirit.

After graduating in 2020, I immediately ventured into laying the foundation of establishing my own company, [Digital Ducks](https://www.digitalducks.co.ke), which I have taken to new heights, offering innovative digital solutions to businesses in various industries. We specialize in software development, media production, digital marketing and, IT support, enabling businesses to navigate the evolving digital landscape and achieve growth and success.

Additionally, my entrepreneurial spirit has driven me towards a deep commitment to making a positive impact on Africa's social and economic landscape. Through [Young Invested](https://www.younginvested.org), we use sports, technology and entrepreneurship as tools to empower young people and act as catalysts for social and economic growth. By leveraging the transformative power of sports, technology, and entrepreneurship, we strive to provide the tools, resources, and mentors necessary to create opportunities and drive positive change within our communities.

### Technical Expertise

As a software engineer, I develop apps and websites that prioritize the needs and engagement of end-users.
