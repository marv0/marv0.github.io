### About Me 

Hello, world!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Marvin Ogot and Iâ€™m an entrepreneur and software engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya. Welcome to my blog!

I started this blog as part of my efforts to keep track of my learning and share relevant information on diverse topics on business and entrepreneurship, and various technologies (*not limited to software*). *Additionally, I may cover topics related to personal development, and more.* If you have the slightest interest in building and delivering great products and services, then this blog is for you!

### Enterpreneurial Drive

At an early age, I learned the importance of having a competitive edge and drive through sports, which laid the foundation for my entrepreneurial journey. While my childhood dreams revolved around sport's science and engineering, the idea of entrepreneurship never crossed my mind until I stumbled upon Robert Kiyosaki's inspiring books, *"Rich Dad, Poor Dad", "Before You Quit Your Job", and "Why A Students Work For C Students", among others,* and my perspective shifted; fueling my burgeoning entrepreneurial spirit!

After graduating in 2020, I immediately ventured into laying the foundation of establishing [Digital Ducks](https://www.digitalducks.co.ke), a dynamic enterprise which we have taken to new heights, offering innovative digital solutions to businesses in various industries. We specialize in software development, media production, digital marketing and, IT support, enabling businesses to navigate the evolving digital landscape and achieve growth and success.

Additionally,  my entrepreneurial spirit has driven me towards a deep commitment to making a positive impact on Africa's social and economic landscape.Through [Young Invested](https://www.younginvested.org), our mission is to empower young people and foster social and economic growth using sports, technology, and entrepreneurship as powerful tools. We believe in harnessing the transformative power of these fields and we provide the necessary tools, resources, mentors, and opportunities for our communities to thrive and drive positive change.

### Technical Expertise

As a software engineer, I develop apps and websites that prioritize the needs and engagement of end-users. By blending my technical expertise, UI/UX design principles, and a user-centric approach, I craft digital products that meet consumer needs and deliver exceptional user experiences. You can view my personal gitgub [here](https://github.com/marv0).

### Closing Remarks

I invite you to join me on this exciting journey as we network, break barriers, and explore uncharted territories together!

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
