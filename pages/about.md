## About Me 

I’m a passionate software developer building scalable digital solutions that make life simpler, smarter, and more connected. With a strong foundation in cloud technologies, and an active curiosity in AI, I love exploring how innovation reshapes the way we live, work, and interact — making everyday experiences more convenient, efficient, and meaningful.For me, technology isn’t just about business growth; it’s about human progress — how ideas evolve into tools that change how we communicate, move, learn, and care for one another. That’s the kind of impact I want to be part of: creating systems that empower both businesses and the people they serve.When I’m not coding or architecting systems, I’m learning, experimenting, and exploring ways to make technology more accessible and impactful.🚀 Let’s connect
