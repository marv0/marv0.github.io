# About The Author

Hello, world! I'm Marvin Ogot.

As a software developer, I have some experience building functional web and mobile applications with the Flutter framework and Dart programming language as some of my most reliable tools. In my arsenal, I also have the Python programming language as a secondary tool, especially for it's wide array of applications. As an entrepreneur, I love building companies that help businesses and indiviuals altogether.
