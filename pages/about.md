## About Me 

Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur on a mission to empower 1M+ young people using sports, technology, and entrepreneurship as transformative tools. 

## Why This Blog?

I started this [blog](/) to document my journey while sharing valuable insights on business, entrepreneurship, and a range of technologies beyond just software. *Moreover, I anticipate delving into areas associated with personal development and more.* If you have, the slightest, interest in building and delivering great products and services, this blog is for you!

## Laying The Foundation

At an early age, I picked up fundamental principles of success such as discipline, commitment, teamwork, and passion (very important) through sports, which laid the foundation for my entrepreneurial journey and my career in technology. While my childhood dreams revolved around sports' science and engineering, entrepreneurship never crossed my mind until I stumbled upon Robert Kiyosaki's inspiring books and philosophies while pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, and my perspective shifted; fueling my burgeoning entrepreneurial spirit! Besides, this was all happening in the midst of the technopreneur era, with the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos, among others being ever so popular. The stars were aligning!

## Pursuing The Dream

Shortly after graduation, I eagerly ventured into laying the foundation of establishing [Digital Ducks](https://www.digitalducks.co.ke), a dynamic enterprise that has since soared to remarkable heights, enabling businesses to navigate the ever-evolving digital landscape and achieve growth and success.

My passion for entrepreneurship has further led me to focus on positively impacting Africaâ€™s social and economic landscape. Through [Young Invested](https://www.younginvested.org), we aim to empower young people and foster social and economic growth within our communities using sports, technology, and entrepreneurship as powerful tools. We believe in harnessing the transformative potential of these fields and providing the essential tools, resources, mentors, and opportunities for our communities to thrive and create positive change.
