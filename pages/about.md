## About Me 

Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur on a mission to empower 1M+ young people using sports, technology and entrepreneurship as transformative tools. 

As a software developer, I create user-centric applications that meet consumer needs and consistently deliver exceptional user experiences.

## Laying The Foundation

At an early age, I learned the importance of having a competitive edge and drive through sports, which laid the foundation for my entrepreneurial journey. While my childhood dreams revolved around sports' science and engineering, the idea of entrepreneurship never crossed my mind until I stumbled upon Robert Kiyosaki's inspiring books and philosophies, and my perspective shifted; fueling my burgeoning entrepreneurial spirit!

## Busy Building

Some of the projects I've worked on and continue to work on:

- **[Digital Ducks](https://www.digitalducks.co.ke):** Our mission is to empower businesses of all sizes by offering the most compelling digital solutions.

- **[Young Invested](https://www.younginvested.org):** A non-profit organization empowering young people using sports, technology and entrepreneurship.

## Laying The Foundation

Shortly after graduation, I eagerly ventured into laying the foundation of establishing [Digital Ducks](https://www.digitalducks.co.ke), a dynamic enterprise that has since soared to remarkable heights, enabling businesses to navigate the ever-evolving digital landscape and achieve growth and success.

My passion for entrepreneurship has further led me to focus on positively impacting Africaâ€™s social and economic landscape. Through [Young Invested](https://www.younginvested.org), we aim to empower young people and foster social and economic growth within our communities using sports, technology, and entrepreneurship as powerful tools. We believe in harnessing the transformative potential of these fields and providing the essential tools, resources, mentors, and opportunities for our communities to thrive and create positive change.
