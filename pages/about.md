## About Me 

Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m a software engineer and entrepreneur on a mission to empower 1M+ young people using sports, technology, and entrepreneurship as transformative tools.

As a full-stack engineer, my toolkit consists of Python and Flask for developing scalable server-side solutions and efficient RESTful APIs while for the front end, React allows me to create rich and interactive user interfaces.

My expertise spans the full development lifecycle, from building powerful backend architectures to creating engaging user experiences on the front end.
I love learning and conversely, this blog serves to share valuable insights on business, entrepreneurship, and technology; beyond software.

If you have the slightest interest in building and delivering great products and services, this blog is for you! 

## Laying The Bricks

At an early age, I picked up fundamental success principles through sports, which laid the foundation for my entrepreneurial journey and my career in technology. While my childhood dreams revolved around sports science and engineering, entrepreneurship never crossed my mind until I stumbled upon Robert Kiyosaki's inspiring books and philosophies, and my perspective shifted; fueling my burgeoning entrepreneurial spirit!

I'm actively building, [Digital Ducks](https://www.digitalducks.co.ke), a dynamic enterprise with a focus on helping businesses thrive in the emerging digital landscape and achieve growth and success. At the same time, as a young individual navigating the pursuit of success through education and entrepreneurship, I encountered a significant challenge: many capable individuals, like myself, were burnt out and not actively pursuing their full potential. Recognizing the need for a network or 'ecosystem' of like-minded individuals to inspire and tap into this potential, I founded Young Invested.

[Young Invested](https://www.younginvested.org), aims to create a sense of community for ambitious individuals, fostering ideas and nurturing them through the transformative power of sports, technology, and entrepreneurship. Our goal is to enable social and economic growth within our communities by harnessing the potential of these fields and providing essential tools, resources, mentors, and opportunities. We believe in empowering our communities to thrive and create positive change.
