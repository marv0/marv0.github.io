Hello, I am Marvin! I am Software Engineer and avid learner who enjoys messing around with technology to do useful things. I am also a sports and fitness enthusiast and occasionally you'll find me building something creative with my hands. When I have some time on my hands, which is almost always, I write and read about topics I like; not just limited to technology but other stuff I find interesting. If you tag along long enough, we will discover some of the things that excite me.

Keep in touch with me:

* Catch me on [Whatsapp](https://wa.me/+254718542880)  
* See my professional profile on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marvin-ogot-6a67a9109/)  
* Or take a look at the technical stuff on [GitHub](https://github.com/marv0)

2. [Machine Learning Blog](https://semasuka.github.io/blog//) - contributing my Machine Learning experience and learning curve in this blog.
