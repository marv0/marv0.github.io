bio: Hello, world!ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a software engineer and entrepreneur on a mission to empower 1M+ young people using sports, technology, and entrepreneurship as transformative tools. 
In my role as a software engineer, I fancy using Flask for developing scalable server-side solutions and efficient RESTful APIs while React allows me to create rich and interactive user interfaces. My expertise spans the full development lifecycle, from building powerful backend architectures to creating engaging user experiences on the front end.
Simultaneously, my entrepreneurial spirit constantly fuels me to seek out opportunities to innovate and create meaningful solutions for empowering both businesses and people.
